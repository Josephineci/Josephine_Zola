## Professional Summary
Growing up in a TV-free household, I developed a love for puzzles, sparking my interest in security and automation. This led me to embark on self-financed learning journeys, such as becoming a System Administrator whilst being a full-time student, transitioning to a role as Junior DevOps Engineer to today as a Security Analyst working on projects reducing system vulnerabilities, enforcing secuirty policies, and optimzing scalability.

A proactive, analytical, and versatile professional with diverse experience brainstorming and developing solutions for complex business problems in a variety of industries and domains.

I‚Äôm a team player. I value building solid and honest relationships with clients and colleagues at all levels of organizations.
